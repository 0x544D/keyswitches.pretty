Footprint | Description/notes | Preview
--------- | ----------------- | -------
PG1350 | Just a plain one-sided mount for [Kailh PG1350](http://kailh.com/en/Products/Ks/CS/) switches | ![PG1350](images/PG1350.png)
PG1350_reversible | Enables the switch to be mounted on either side of the PCB, similar to the switch mounts on the original Ergodox PCBs | ![PG1350 reversible](images/PG1350_reversible.png)
PG1350_rotatable | Enables the switch to be mounted on either side of the PCB *and* optionally rotated 90Â° by the person assembling the board. This option is intended to allow the board assembler to accomodate keycaps that only fit in a particular orientation. | ![PG1350 rotatable](images/PG1350_rotatable.png)

The plate footprint and outer edge of the switches themselves, as well as the LED mount area, are marked on the layer Eco2.User
